Phase (1):
- At customer site, we will proceed to deploy the RedHat openstack platform without the use of red hat director, upon which will enable us to perform the below:
   a) Hands on lab for customer to fully understand how the components react and communicate to deploy services.
   b) Perform sessions to customer regarding the stack platform itself and its various components/services that could be utilized.

Phase Technical Steps:
- Initiate deployment at customer site servers, as below:
   a) Perform physical servers initial configuration and operating systems deployment.
   b) Proceed to deploy the openstack platform services on each respective node assigned, using scripts which are tested/prepared.
   c) Provide the customer with the Stack GUI, upon which he can view and interact with the cloud services.

Phase Completion parameters:
- The phase success points can be detailed as below:
   a) Successful deployment of the stack and its selected services (compute/control/storage/networking...etc).
   b) Successful testing of each service to operate and co-operate with other services as intended.
   c) Successful Host to Host virtual networking provisioning.
   d) Customer sessions completion.

Phase (2):
- At this point, we will proceed to deploy the RedHat openstack platform with the use of red hat director, upon which will enable us to perform the below:
  a) Display for the customer what deployment steps the director could automate.
  b) The usage of a single node openstack platform (undercloud) to manage another openstack installation (overcloud).

Phase Technical Steps:
- Initiate deployment at customer site servers, as below:
   a) Deploy Redhat Openstack with High Availability ( one undercloud node , three controller nodes , three compute nodes , three ceph storage node ) using local repository.
   b) Provide the customer with GUI for undercloud/director and Stack GUI.

Phase Completion parameters:
- The phase success points can be detailed as below:
   a) Successful deployment of the stack and its selected services using redhat director.
   b) Successful testing of each service to operate and co-operate with other services as intended.
   c) Successful testing of Highly available nodes. (failure and data integrity tests).
   d) Successful testing of ceph nodes operation (OSDs addition/removal).

Phase (3):
- This phase will be dedicated for any and all external integration with services/platforms outside of the OpenStack, upon which will enable us to perform the below:
   a) Assist in 3rd party integrations from the OpenStack perspective.
   b) Provide endpoints/APIs for integration usage.

Phase Technical Steps:
* Highly dependable on 3rd party platforms/services that are requested for integration.
